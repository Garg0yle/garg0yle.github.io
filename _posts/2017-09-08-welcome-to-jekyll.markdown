Welcome to the Gittis Lab at Carnegie Mellon University!

Our main objective is to understand how distinct cell types in the basal ganglia wire up and communicate to regulate behavior in health and disease.   We utilize genetic and molecular tools to target and manipulate distinct neural circuits in acute slices and awake behaving animals.  Experimental approaches include electrophysiology, optogenetics, histology, and behavior.

Postdoctoral positions are now available, please contact Dr. Aryn Gittis (agittis@cmu.edu).
